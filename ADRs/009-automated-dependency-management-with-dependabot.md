# ADR 009: Automated Dependency Management with Dependabot

## Status

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2026-01-25

## Context
This project relies on multiple external dependencies including NuGet packages (.NET libraries), GitHub Actions workflows, and Docker base images. Without automated dependency management, these dependencies can become outdated, leading to:

- **Security vulnerabilities**: Unpatched dependencies may contain known security flaws (CVEs)
- **Technical debt accumulation**: The longer dependencies remain outdated, the harder and riskier updates become
- **Manual overhead**: Manually tracking and updating dependencies across multiple ecosystems is time-consuming and error-prone
- **Compatibility issues**: Delayed updates can lead to breaking changes accumulating, making future upgrades more difficult

We need a systematic approach to keep dependencies current while maintaining code quality and stability.

## Decision
We will use GitHub Dependabot to automatically monitor and update dependencies across three package ecosystems:

1. **NuGet packages** - .NET project dependencies
2. **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD workflow dependencies
3. **Docker** - Container base images

Configuration details:
- Weekly update schedule (Mondays at 9:00 AM Europe/Madrid)
- Grouped minor and patch updates to reduce PR noise
- Automatic assignment and labeling for easy triage
- Conventional commit messages for changelog generation
- Maximum 10 open PRs for NuGet, 5 for Actions/Docker

## Rationale / Tradeoffs

### Advantages
- **Proactive security**: Automatically receive security patches and vulnerability fixes as they become available
- **Reduced maintenance burden**: Eliminates manual dependency tracking and update scheduling
- **Smaller, safer updates**: Regular incremental updates are less risky than large, infrequent updates
- **Improved visibility**: Pull requests provide clear changelogs and release notes for each update
- **Automated testing**: Each dependency update triggers CI pipelines, catching breaking changes early
- **Compliance support**: Helps maintain compliance with security policies requiring up-to-date dependencies
- **Zero cost**: Dependabot is free for public and private GitHub repositories

### Disadvantages / Risks
- **PR volume**: Can generate many pull requests, requiring review discipline and triage processes
- **False positives**: Some updates may trigger test failures or compatibility issues requiring investigation
- **Breaking changes**: Even minor/patch updates can occasionally introduce breaking changes
- **Review overhead**: Team must allocate time to review, test, and merge dependency updates
- **Noise in commit history**: Frequent dependency updates can clutter git history (mitigated by grouping)

## Consequences
- Dependency updates will be proposed automatically via pull requests on a weekly basis
- Team members must establish a review process for Dependabot PRs (e.g., weekly triage sessions)
- CI/CD pipelines must be robust enough to catch breaking changes from dependency updates
- We may need to adjust grouping strategies or ignore specific packages if update volume becomes unmanageable
- Security-critical updates should be prioritized and merged quickly
- The configuration can be tuned over time based on team capacity and update patterns
