description: Any user request involving commit messages
---

Any user request involving commit messages must follow a lightweight Conventional Commits format. The commit title must use an approved type (feat, fix, chore, refactor, docs, test) and be written in the imperative mood with a concise, readable description. Jira issue references must be included in the commit footer. Responses that do not follow these guidelines are not permitted.
